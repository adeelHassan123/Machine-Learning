# Day 17: Fetching and Processing Data from APIs

This folder shows how to use Python to fetch data from web APIs and process it for analysis.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Making HTTP Requests:**
  - Using the `requests` library to get data from a web API (e.g., The Movie Database API).
- **Understanding API Responses:**
  - Checking response status codes (200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.).
- **Working with JSON Data:**
  - Converting API responses to JSON and loading them into pandas DataFrames.
- **Combining Data from Multiple Pages:**
  - Looping through multiple API pages and combining results into a single DataFrame.
- **Saving Data:**
  - Exporting the final DataFrame to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Libraries Used
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to APIs.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and saving to CSV.

## Why This is Important
APIs are a common way to access up-to-date data from the internet. Knowing how to fetch and process API data is essential for many data projects.
