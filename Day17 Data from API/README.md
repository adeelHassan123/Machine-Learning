This folder shows you how to get data from web APIs and turn it into something you can analyze in Python. APIs are how websites and apps share data with you.

## What You'll Learn Here

- How to make HTTP requests to get data from a web API using the requests library.
- How to check if your request was successful by looking at the response code.
- How to convert the data you get (usually in JSON format) into a pandas DataFrame.
- How to combine data from multiple pages of an API into one big table.
- How to save your final data to a CSV file for later use.

## Why This Folder is Useful

APIs are everywhere, and knowing how to get data from them is a super useful skill. This folder gives you a hands-on example of how to fetch, process, and save data from an API, which you can use in many real-world projects.
