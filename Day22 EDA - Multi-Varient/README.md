# Day 22: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Multivariate and Automated Profiling

This folder is about exploring your data by looking at how multiple variables relate to each other (multivariate analysis) and using tools to automatically create detailed reports about your data.

## What You'll Learn Here

- How to load a dataset using pandas.
- How to use automated profiling tools like pandas-profiling or ydata-profiling to quickly generate a report about your data.
- How to find statistics, correlations, missing values, and visualizations in your data with just a few lines of code.
- How to save these reports as HTML files for easy sharing and review.

## Why This Folder is Useful

Multivariate analysis helps you see the bigger picture and understand how different parts of your data interact. Automated profiling saves you time and gives you a comprehensive overview of your dataset, which is very helpful before starting any modeling work.
