# Day 22: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Multivariate & Automated Profiling

This folder explores multivariate EDA (analyzing relationships between multiple variables) and introduces automated data profiling tools.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Loading Data:**
  - Using pandas to read the dataset (`train.csv`).
- **Automated Data Profiling:**
  - Using `pandas-profiling` or `ydata-profiling` to generate a detailed report about the dataset.
  - The report includes statistics, correlations, missing values, and visualizations.
- **Saving Reports:**
  - Exporting the profiling report to an HTML file for easy sharing and review.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data loading and manipulation.
- **pandas-profiling / ydata-profiling**: For automated EDA reports.

## Why This is Important
Multivariate EDA helps you understand how variables interact, which is crucial for feature engineering and modeling. Automated profiling saves time and gives a comprehensive overview of your data.

**This folder is a great way to quickly understand and visualize your dataset!**
