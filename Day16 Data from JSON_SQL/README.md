# Day 16: Working with JSON and SQL Data

This folder demonstrates how to read and process data from JSON files, APIs, and SQL databases using Python and pandas.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Reading JSON Files:
  - Using pd.read_json() to load data from a local JSON file.
- Reading JSON from APIs:
  - Loading JSON data directly from a web API into a pandas DataFrame.
- Working with SQL Databases:
  - Connecting to a MySQL database using mysql.connector.
  - (Note: Actual SQL queries are not shown, but you are encouraged to explore pd.read_sql_query() in pandas documentation.)

## Libraries Used

- pandas: For reading and manipulating data.
- mysql.connector: For connecting to MySQL databases.

## Why This is Important

Real-world data often comes in formats like JSON or is stored in databases. Learning to access and process this data is a key skill for data analysts and scientists.

This folder is a starting point for working with diverse data sources in Python!
