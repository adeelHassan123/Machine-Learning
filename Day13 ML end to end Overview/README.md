# Day 13: Machine Learning End-to-End Overview

This folder demonstrates a complete workflow for a simple machine learning project using Python. The main focus is on understanding the steps involved in building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Data Loading:** Using pandas to read and explore the dataset (`placement.csv`).
- **Data Visualization:** Using matplotlib to visualize the relationship between features (CGPA, IQ) and placement outcomes.
- **Data Preparation:**
  - Selecting relevant columns.
  - Splitting data into features (X) and target (Y).
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
  - Scaling features using `StandardScaler` for better model performance.
- **Model Building:**
  - Using `LogisticRegression` from scikit-learn to build a classification model.
  - Training the model on the training data.
- **Prediction and Evaluation:**
  - Making predictions on the test set.
  - Evaluating model accuracy using `accuracy_score`.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tools (splitting data, scaling, modeling, evaluation).

## Why This is Important
This workflow is a foundation for any machine learning project. It helps you understand how to:
- Prepare your data
- Build and train a model
- Evaluate its performance

**By following these steps, you can apply machine learning to a wide range of real-world problems!**
