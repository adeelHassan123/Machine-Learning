# Day 13: Machine Learning End-to-End Overview

This folder is all about showing you the complete process of building a simple machine learning model from start to finish. The code here uses a dataset called `placement.csv` to predict whether a student will get placed based on their CGPA and IQ.

## What You'll Learn Here

- How to load and explore data:
  You'll see how to use pandas to read a CSV file and look at the first few rows to understand what your data looks like.

- How to visualize data:
  The code uses matplotlib to create a scatter plot, helping you see the relationship between CGPA, IQ, and placement.

- How to prepare data for machine learning:
  You'll learn how to split your data into features (inputs) and target (output), and then divide it into training and testing sets. It also shows how to scale your data so that all features are on a similar scale, which helps many machine learning models work better.

- How to build and train a model:
  The code uses logistic regression, a popular algorithm for classification problems. You'll see how to train the model on your data.

- How to make predictions and check accuracy:
  After training, the model makes predictions on the test data, and you'll learn how to measure how accurate those predictions are.

## Why This Folder is Useful

If you're new to machine learning, this folder gives you a step-by-step example of the whole process, from loading data to evaluating a model. It's a great starting point for understanding how real-world machine learning projects are done.
