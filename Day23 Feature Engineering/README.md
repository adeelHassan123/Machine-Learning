# Day 23: Feature Engineering

This folder introduces the concept of feature engineering, which is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.

## Key Concepts Covered

- What is Feature Engineering?
  - Creating new features from raw data.
  - Transforming or combining existing features to make them more useful for models.
- Why is it Important?
  - Good features can make a big difference in model accuracy and performance.
  - Helps models learn patterns more effectively.

## Typical Feature Engineering Techniques

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling and normalizing data
- Creating interaction features
- Extracting date and time features

## Libraries Commonly Used

- pandas: For data manipulation.
- scikit-learn: For preprocessing and feature transformation.
- seaborn: For data visualization.

## Why This is Important

Feature engineering is a key step in any data science or machine learning project. It often determines the success of your models.
