# Day 23: Feature Engineering

This folder is all about feature engineering, which means creating new features or changing existing ones to help your machine learning models work better.

## What You'll Learn Here

- How to split your data into training and testing sets.
- How to scale your data so that all features are on a similar scale, which helps many models perform better.
- How to visualize your data before and after scaling, so you can see the difference.
- Why scaling is important for machine learning.
- How to train and compare models with and without scaling to see the impact on accuracy.

## Why This Folder is Useful

Feature engineering is a key part of any data science or machine learning project. The steps you learn here will help you get better results from your models and understand your data more deeply.
