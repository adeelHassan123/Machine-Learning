# Day 25: Data Normalization and Preprocessing

This folder is all about understanding and applying normalization techniques to your data. Normalization is an important step in data preprocessing, especially before using machine learning models, because it helps put all your features on a similar scale.

## What You'll Learn Here

- How to load and explore a real dataset (wine_data.csv) using pandas.
- How to visualize your data using seaborn and matplotlib to see the distribution of features like Alcohol and Malic Acid.
- How to use automated profiling tools (ydata-profiling) to quickly generate a detailed report about your data.
- How to split your data into training and testing sets for machine learning.
- How to apply Min-Max normalization to scale your features between 0 and 1, making them easier for models to work with.
- How to use RobustScaler for mean normalization, which is less sensitive to outliers.
- How to compare your data before and after normalization using summary statistics and scatter plots.

## Why This Folder is Useful

Normalization is a key part of preparing your data for machine learning. It helps models learn better and faster by making sure all features contribute equally. This folder gives you hands-on practice with different normalization techniques and shows you how to visualize and compare the results.

If you're new to data science or machine learning, this is a great place to learn about one of the most important steps in the data preparation process!
